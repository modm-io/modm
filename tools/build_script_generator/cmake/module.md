# CMake Build Script Generator

[CMake][] is a widely used build tool supported by almost every IDE.

This module generates three files:

- a `modm/repo.cmake` file: configures all required CMake tools with
  the right settings (also using information from the `modm:build` module) to
  compile the modm library.
- a top-level `CMakeLists.txt`: configures CMake to build modm and your
  application.
- a top-level `Makefile`: provides a convenience wrapper for calling CMake from
  the command line.

This module is intended to be used for integration with IDEs that natively only
support CMake. It therefore only provides the bare minimum of features to compile
and upload your application to your target. For additional build tools features
see the `modm:build:scons` module.


## Make Methods

The `Makefile` wrapper provides these convenience methods.


#### make cmake

Generates the CMake build folders and initializes the build system.

```
 $ make cmake
    ...
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: build/{project.name}/cmake-build-release
    ...
-- Build files have been written to: build/{project.name}/cmake-build-debug
```

!!! note "You must call this once before you can build!"
    If you forget to call this first, the build will fail with this error message:

    ```
     $ make build-release
    Error: build/cmake-build-release is not a directory
    make: *** [build-release] Error 1
    ```


#### make build-release
#### make build-debug

Compiles your application into an executable using the release or debug profile.

```
 $ make build-release

```


#### make upload-release
#### make upload-debug

Writes the executable onto your target via AvrDude or OpenOCD.
This is a convenience wrapper around the programming options and methods
defined in the `modm:build` module.
(\* *only AVR and ARM Cortex-M targets*)

```
 $ make upload-release

```


#### make gdb
#### make gdb-release

Launches GDB with the debug or release executable.
This is just a convenience wrapper for the debug functionality defined in the
`modm:build` module.
(\* *only ARM Cortex-M targets*)

**OpenOCD must already be running in the background**. Launch it by manually
calling `make openocd` in another terminal.


#### make openocd

Starts OpenOCD with the modm specific configuration.


#### make clean

Removes the CMake build artifacts.


#### make cleanall

Removes the entire build folder. You must then first call `make cmake` before
being able to build again.
