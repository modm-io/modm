/**
 * This code should _only_ enable internal memories and nothing else.
 * Since this is the first code executed after a reset, you do not
 * have access to _any_ data stored in RAM, since it has not yet been
 * initialized.
 * In the worst case you won't even have access to the stack, if the
 * memory containing the stack is not physically enabled yet.
 * In that case, consider using inline assembly to manage stack access
 * manually, until the memory is enabled.
