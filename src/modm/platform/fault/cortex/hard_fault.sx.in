	/* When a hard fault occurs, this handler will move the stack pointer around.
 	 * This makes it harder to debug a hard fault with a real debugger, so if one is connected we would
	 * like to trigger a software breakpoint before moving the stack pointer.
	 * The decision to trigger the breakpoint needs to happen at runtime and not at compile time,
	 * since when a hard fault has been triggered, you want to debug the binary on the device and not
	 * compile a new binary with the breakpoint in it, which might then prevent the fault from occurring.
	 *
	 * The Cortex-M3 Core Debug module contains the "Debug Halting Control and Status Register" (DHCSR),
	 * which contains the `C_DEBUGEN` bit, which is set by the debugger to enable halting debug.
	 * "If halting debug is enabled [...], captured events will halt the processor in Debug state."
	 * You can test if halting debug is enabled using `(CoreDebug->DHCSR & CoreDebug_DHCSR_C_DEBUGEN_Msk)`.
	 *
	 * !!!WARNING:
	 *    "If DHCSR.C_DEBUGEN is clear and a breakpoint occurs in an NMI or HardFault exception handler,
	 *     the system locks up with an unrecoverable error."
	 *
	 * Since we are using a breakpoint inside the HardFault exception handler, we must therefore always
	 * check this flag, before executing the breakpoint.
	 *
	 * !!!WARNING:
	 *     On ARMv6-M "access to the DHCSR from software running on the processor is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED."
	 *     This means, that on Cortex-M0, it might not be possible to read the DHCSR from software!
	 *
	 * Neither STM32F0 nor LPC11 implement this access!
	 *
	 * !!!WARNING:
	 *     OpenOcd does not reset the `C_DEBUGEN` bit on the `shutdown` command. This might be a bug.
	 *     A workaround is to issue `reset halt`, then manually reset the bits using `mww 0xE000EDF0 0xA05F0000`.
	 *     This will also clear the `C_HALT` bit and therefore this is equivalent to `reset run`.
	 *
	 * !!!WARNING:
	 *    `C_DEBUGEN` is sticky! It survives all resets but a power-on reset. This means that after debugging
	 *    either power cycle the target or manually clear `C_DEBUGEN` using `mww 0xE000EDF0 0xA05F0000`.
