# Board Support Packages

modm provides pre-configured BSPs for several commercial off-the-shelf
development boards. There are two main components to the BPSs:

1. An inheritable configuration `board.xml` containing the HAL target, options
   and the board module. This pre-defined configuration is aliased as a repo
   configuration so that your `project.xml` simply `<extends>modm:{board-name}</extends>`.
2. A module `modm:board:{board-name}` that pulls in required dependencies,
   configures the modm library and provides the code to initialize the board.
   You can then `#include <modm/board.hpp>` in your project.

The BSPs all use a common interface within a top-level `namespace Board`:

- `Board::initialize()`: Initializes the targets clock system, logger, LEDs and
  Buttons.
- `Board::initialize{subsystem}()`: Initializes optional board subsystems.
- `Board::SystemClock`: Provides the clock configuration for use in
  `Peripheral::initialize<Board::SystemClock, ...>()`.
- `Board::Led{name}`: Board-specific LEDs  are initialized as outputs and off.
- `Board::Leds`: A `modm::platform::SoftwareGpioPort` containing all board LEDs.
- `Board::Button`: Board-specific input buttons are initialized as input with
  pull-up/down as required.
- `Board::{pin-name}`: All board-specific pins are aliased to their respective
  `modm::platform::Gpio{port}{pin}`.

If the board supports a dedicated serial logging output the BSP redirects the
`modm:debug` module debug stream `MODM_LOG_INFO` etc.

Please note that YOU must explicitly call the `Board` functions to initialize
your hardware, just including the board module is not enough.
Here is an example using the `modm:disco-f469ni` BSP:

```cpp
#include <modm/board.hpp>

int main()
{
	// ALWAYS initialize the board first!
	Board::initialize();
	// Then initialize the subsystems you want to use
	Board::initializeDisplay();

	// Set LEDs via the GPIO port
	Board::Leds::write(0b1011);

	// Use the Arduino pin names
	Board::D0::setOutput(modm::Gpio::High);
	Board::D1::setInput();

	// Use the boards serial logging
	MODM_LOG_INFO << "REBOOT!" << modm::endl;

	while (true) {
		// Link the LED to the button
		Board::LedBlue::set(Board::Button:read());
	}
	return 0;
}
```

!!! warning "Only select one BSP module"
	Even though some targets have multiple BSPs modules available (for example:
	Blue Pill and Black Pill), you can only use one module, since all define the
	same functions resulting in naming conflicts.


## Customization

The BSPs contain an opinionated set of pre-defined functionality and settings.
This is great for just quickly prototyping something, however, when you want to
use custom hardware, or even just change a few settings, it's better to use your
own BSP:

1. Generate the BSP closest to your custom hardware, then copy the files from
   `modm/src/modm/board/{name}` to your own project and modify them.
2. In your `project.xml` remove the board config inheritance (`<extends>`) and
   instead copy the pre-defined options into your own config.
3. Check what modm modules you need to depend on and add them to your own project
   (check for `module.depends(...)` in the BSPs `module.lb`).
4. You may need to manually add the pre-defined collector values to your project
   configuration (check for `env.collect(...)` in the BSPs `module.lb`).
