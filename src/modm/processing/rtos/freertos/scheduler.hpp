		 * FreeRTOS Scheduler	
		 * 
		 * <h2>Interrupt Priorities</h2>
		 * 
		 * The STM32 implements only four priority bits. The lower four bits of
		 * the eight bit priority register are unused. A lower value means a
		 * higher priority.
	 	 * Therefore 0 (=0) is the highest priority and 15 (=15 << 4 => 0xf0)
	 	 * is the lowest priority.
		 * 
		 * The Kernel has the lowest possible priority 15 to make sure that it
		 * is not interrupting any other interrupt. During the execution of
		 * an API function the priority is raised to 11.
		 * 
		 * Any interrupt that calls an API function must have a priority
		 * between 15 and 11, otherwise the system might crash.
		 *
		 * Interrupts that do not use any FreeRTOS API functions can use any
		 * interrupt priority. If the priority is higher (lower value) than 11
		 * the execution won't be delayed by anything the kernel is doing.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * \warning	vTaskEndScheduler() will not work for the STM32 port of
		 * 			FreeRTOS therefore no stop() method is implemented here.
		 * 			See the README file in ext/freertos/port for more details.
