/**
 * @ingroup		interface
 * @defgroup	delay	Blocking delays
 *
 * These functions allow you to spin for a short time using only the CPU.
 *
 * You should always prefer Software Timers (@see software_timer) over these
 * *blocking* delay functions. However, when `xpcc::Clock` is not set up yet, or
 * when you need very small delays (for example to bit-bang a protocol), you need
 * to use these delay functions.
 *
 * The only guarantee given to you is to delay for _at least_ the specified time.
 * Note that invocation of interrupts during spinning may add delay too.
 *
 * @warning
 *    You must not rely on delay functions for ANY time-keeping!
 *
 * Delay functions work at any CPU clock speed, even if changed dynamically and
 * are available very early in the startup process at hardware-init time.
 *
 * @warning
 *    Correct behavior is not guaranteed for delays over 1000ns, us or ms!
 *    Make sure to use the largest time unit possible.
