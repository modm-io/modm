/**
 * @ingroup		interface
 * @defgroup	assert	Assertions
 *
 * These functions allow you to assert a condition at runtime and define
 * failure handlers in your application that can decide what to do with this
 * assertion and provide custom functionality.
 *
 * Each assertion has the form `modm_assert(condition, module, location, failure)`,
 * where the condition is a boolean and rest are strings, so that a simple
 * string compare can be used to match for module, location or failure.
 * For example, the identifier `"can", "init", "timeout"` describes a timeout
 * failure in the CAN initializer function.
 * The assert `modm_assert_debug(condition, module, location, failure)` is only
 * available on debug builds and is removed from the code for a release build.
 *
 * The user can define one or multiple assertion handlers in any part of the
 * application using the `MODM_ASSERTION_HANDLER(function)` macro.
 * All assertion handlers will be executed when an assertion fails anywhere in
 * the code and get passed the identifier string.
 *
 * @note The order of assertion handler execution is undefined and must not be
 *       relied upon for any functionality!
 * @warning Assertion handlers may be executed in interrupt context!
 *
 * Depending on the information in the failure identifier, the assertion handler
 * returns `Abandonment::DontCare` if the failure is not of interest, or
 * `Abandonment::Ignore` for recoverable failures, or `Abandonment::Fail` for
 * failures that do not allow normal program continuation.
 * The program is aborted, if any assertion handler returns `Abandonment::Fail`,
 * all assertion handlers return `Abandonment::DontCare` or no assertion
 * handlers have been defined in the application.
 * Only if one or many assertion handlers return `Abandonment::Ignore` and the
 * remainder returns `Abandonment::DontCare`, only then is the assertion ignored.
 *
 * @note It is intended that the assertion handlers do not block (forever), so
 *       that all assertion handlers can get called.
 *
 * On program abandonment `modm_abandon(module, location, failure)` is called,
 * which exits the program silently by default.
 * Only on hosted an formatted error string is output by default.
 * It is therefore recommended to overwrite this function on embedded targets
 * for custom behavior like blinking an LED and printing to a serial connection.
 *
 * @warning The abandonment handler may also be executed in interrupt context!
