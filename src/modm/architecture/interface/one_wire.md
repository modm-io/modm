# 1-Wire

1-Wire is a device communications bus system designed by
Dallas Semiconductor Corp. that provides low-speed data, signaling and
power over a single signal. 1-Wire is similar in concept to I²C, but
with lower data rates and longer range. It is typically used to communicate
with small inexpensive devices such as digital thermometers and
weather instruments.

One distinctive feature of the bus is the possibility to use only two
wires: data and ground. To accomplish this, 1-wire devices include an
800 pF capacitor to store charge, and power the device during periods where
the data line is used for data.
