/**
 * Base class of an I2C Device.
 *
 * This class provides functions for configuring the adapter and peripheral and starting transactions.
 * It also provides a basic `ping()` resumable function, which checks if the device responds to its address.
 *
 * You need to provide the number of required nesting levels for your driver here.
 * By default, 10 levels are chosen, which should be more than enough in any case.
 *
 * You can choose to use your own custom I2c Transaction Adapter, by providing a class subclassed from
 * an existing I2cAdapter or which implements the I2cTransaction interface manually.
 *
 * @tparam	I2cMaster		an I2cMaster conforming to the I2cMaster interface.
 * @tparam	NestingLevels	number of nesting levels required for your driver
 * @tparam	Transaction		a class conforming to the I2cTransaction interface.
