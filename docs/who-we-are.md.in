## History of modm

In the mid-2000s the [Roboterclub Aachen e.V.][rca_ev] has developed a software
library called XPCC for communication among components that are distributed on
PCs and microcontrollers. This library was initially used only in autonomous
robots for the [Eurobot competition][eurobot].

In 2009, XPCC became a separate project and over the years grew from a communication
library to a general purpose framework (called lowercase xpcc, 'cos #namingthings) suitable for all
kinds of embedded applications.

Between 2016 and 2018, Niklas and Fabian refactored xpcc into modm by completely
rewriting the way the library generates its HAL. This also gave us the tools to
fix some larger architectural issues in xpcc's HAL as well as significantly
improve customizability of the HAL and its documentation.
All xpcc authors agreed to relicense their contributions from BSD to MPLv2 in modm.


## Eurobot and Team RCA

Most of our contributors are or used to be members of the
[Roboterclub Aachen e.V.](http://roboterclub.rwth-aachen.de).
We've been building robots for the [Eurobot competition][eurobot] for many years
now and all of them have been running xpcc or modm successfully as their only OS
on dozens of different AVR and STM32 targets each.
So modm is truly battle-tested in real-world conditions and has passed through
the scrutiny of many capable engineers over the years.

Check out how we're competing in the quarter finals of the Eurobot 2015 competition.
