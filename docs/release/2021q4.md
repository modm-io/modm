## 2022-01-01: 2021q4 release

This release covers everything from 2021-10-01 and has been tested with avr-gcc
v10.2.0 from Upstream and arm-none-eabi-gcc 10.3-2021.10 from Arm.

Breaking changes:

- `modm:driver:encoder_input.bitbang` has changed its API.
- `modm::Saturated` class has been completely refactored.

Features:

- STM32F1 internal flash driver.
- Use FreeRTOS with static memory by default.
- SAMG UART driver.
- SAMG ADC driver.
- STM32F4 Ethernet support via FreeRTOS+TCP.
- STM32F4 and STM32F7 DMA support.
- VSCode IDE support via `modm:ide:vscode`.
- Experimental support for fibers.
- Vector table remap into SRAM on Cortex-M0+ and STM32F0.
- STM32H7 DMA driver.

Integrated Projects:

- ETL added at v20.22.0.
- TinyUSB upgraded to v0.12.0.
- FreeRTOS upgraded to 202112.00.
- LVGL upgraded to v8.1.0.

Fixes:

- Remove heap dependency for static virtual destructors.
- Correct STM32G4/L4+ voltage scaling and boost mode.
- Move main stack to DMA-able memory for STM32F4.
- Linkerscript alignment issues for copy sections.
- Zero SRAM after uploading to prevent false positive RTT identifier.
- Off-by-One error in EXTI IRQ handler.
- DMA data fixes for STM32G0, L4, H7 and WL.
- Do not reset STM32 Advanced Timer RCR during configuration.

New development boards:

- NUCLEO-L053R8 as `modm:board:nucleo-l053r8`.

New device drivers:

- TMP12{1,3,5} temperature sensor as `modm:driver:tmp12x`.
- Encoder Input via STM32 Timer as `modm:driver:encoder_input`.
- MCP7941X RTC driver with EUI-48/64 and EEPROM as `modm:driver:mcp7941x`.
- ADS816X ADC diver as `modm:driver:ads816x`.

Known bugs:

- Cannot set breakpoints on specific lines in debug profile. See #777.
- C++20 is not fully implemented by GCC10 yet, however modm does not use all
  features yet anyways. See #326.
- STM32F7: D-Cache not enabled by default. See #485.
- `lbuild build` and `lbuild clean` do not remove all previously generated files
  when the configuration changes. See #285.
- Generating modm on Windows creates paths with `\` that are not compatible with
  Unix. See #310.
- `arm-none-eabi-gdb` TUI and GDBGUI interfaces are not supported on Windows.
  See #591.
