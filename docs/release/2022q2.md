## 2022-07-01: 2022q2 release

This release covers everything from 2022-04-01 and has been tested with avr-gcc
v11.2.0 from upstream and arm-none-eabi-gcc 10.3-2021.10 from Arm.

Breaking changes:

- None.

Features:

- Custom OpenOCD binary path.
- IRQ handlers for RP2040.
- Expose transmission complete flag on STM32 UART.
- Half transfer handler for STM32 DMA.
- Timer `SlaveModeTrigger::Internal0`/`Internal3` for STM32F4.
- UI Button group refactoring.
- MovingAverage filter refactoring.
- Support for std::chrono in STM32 timer API.

Integrated Projects:

- ETL upgraded to v20.29.3.
- CrashCatcher updated to latest version.

Fixes:

- Fix STM32F7 linker script issue causing memory corruption on some devices.
- STM32H7 RCC clock output.
- CAN system clock frequencies for Nucleo-F446RE/Nucleo-F446ZE boards.
- Cortex-M ITM when `buffer.tx` option not set.
- `Rcc::disable()` on STM32 disabling unrelated clocks.
- Fix `GpioSampler` difference computation.
- Fix missing DMAable capability for DTCM RAM on STM32F7.

New development boards:

- Support for revision B-02 of the DISCO-F469NI development board as
  `modm:disco-f469ni:b-02`.

New device drivers:

- MAX31855 thermocouple-to-digital converter as `modm:driver:max31855`
- ADS101X ADC as `modm:driver:ads101x`
- MS5611 pressure sensor as `modm:driver:ms5611`

Known bugs:

- Cannot set breakpoints on specific lines in debug profile. See #777.
- C++20 is not fully implemented by GCC10 yet, however modm does not use all
  features yet anyways. See #326.
- STM32F7: D-Cache not enabled by default. See #485.
- `lbuild build` and `lbuild clean` do not remove all previously generated files
  when the configuration changes. See #285.
- Generating modm on Windows creates paths with `\` that are not compatible with
  Unix. See #310.
- `arm-none-eabi-gdb` TUI and GDBGUI interfaces are not supported on Windows.
  See #591.
