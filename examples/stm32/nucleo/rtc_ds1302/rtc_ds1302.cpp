 * Realtime Clock RTC DS1302 test.
 *
 * This example compares the internal oscillator of the processor with an external
 * Real Time Clock (RTC).
 *
 * External hardware is a "RTC DS1302 module" connected to D8, D9 and D10.
 * See the code for the pinout.
 *
 * The expected result should be:
 * \code
 * Welcome to RTC DS1302 demo.
 * CPU frequency is 16000000 Hz
 * *  9.995 seconds from CPU are 10 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.975 seconds from CPU are 10 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.955 seconds from CPU are 10 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.935 seconds from CPU are 10 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.915 seconds from CPU are 10 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.895 seconds from CPU are 10 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.875 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.876 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.877 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.878 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.879 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.880 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.881 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.882 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.883 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.884 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.885 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.886 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
 * *  9.887 seconds from CPU are  9 seconds from RTC.
