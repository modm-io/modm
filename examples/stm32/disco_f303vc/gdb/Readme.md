# Debugging with GDB and OpenOCD

To debug MODM programs on your target you need OpenOCD
as well as a target specific _arm-none-eabi-_ **gdb** in your PATH.

If you only want to debug this _gdb_ example project, you can skip right to
the **Start Debugging** section.

## Prepare your Project

### Compiling with Debug Symbols

To compile code that is easily debugged, you need to specify some flags
in your local _SConstruct_ file:

	env['CXXFLAGS'].append("-O0")	# no optimizations
	env['CXXFLAGS'].append("-g")	# include debug symbols


## Start Debugging

### Program Target

You can load your code onto the target using _scons program_ as usual
or you can use gdb (how? _TBD....sorry_).

### Start OpenOCD as GDB server

	scons openocd-debug


### Start GDB

In a different terminal run gdb with the path to your _.elf_ file.

	scons debug


### Use GDB

Now you can set breakpoints:

	b main.cpp:93

Continue to them

	c

Inspect variables:

	p a

Look around in the source code

	l

Turn on mixed assembly/C++ view (it is best to maximize your terminal window)

	layout split

Step into functions

	s

Go to next assembly instruction

	ni

And much more. See the _Useful GDB Commands_ section.


### Useful GDB Commands

* **info break** (_i b_): list all breakpoints
* **break** (_b_): set breakpoint; e.g. "b main.cpp:120"
* **continue** (_c_): continue to next breakpoint
* **layout split**: display C/C++ code as well as assembler instructions in window
* **layout regs**:  display registers in window
* **list** (_l_): show
* **next** (_n_): next line; do not step into
* **step** (_s_): steps into function
* **nexti** (_ni_): go to next machine instruction
* **stepi** (_si_): step one machine instruction
* **print** (_p_): print variable (i.e. _p a_, for reg0 _p $r0_, for reg2 in hex _p/x $r0_)
* **set** (_s_): set variable (i.e. _s a=10_, _s $reg2=16_)
* **info registers** (_i r_): show registers and content
* **info registers XX** (_i r XX_): replace XX by register name
