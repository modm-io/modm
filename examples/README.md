# Examples, glorious Examples!

<!--examples-->
The easiest way for you to learn about modm's APIs is to look at and experiment
[with our examples](https://github.com/modm-io/modm/tree/develop/examples),
especially if you have a development board that modm supports out-of-box.

Make sure you've [installed all tools required for building modm](https://modm.io/guide/installation).


## TL;DR

```
lbuild build    # generate modm library (call only once)
scons program   # compile and upload to your development board
```

To debug with GDB in TUI mode:

```
scons program profile=debug # compile and upload debug profile
scons gdb profile=debug     # launch OpenOCD and GDB for debugging
```

To generate your target specific Doxygen documentation:

```
(cd modm/docs && doxygen doxyfile.cfg)  # may take a minute or two
# open modm/docs/html/index.html
```

To remove it all:

```
scons -c      # removes build artifacts
lbuild clean  # removes generated files
```


## Quickstart

To generate the modm library for the specific example target, call

```
lbuild build
```

You can then look at the generated modm code in the local `modm/src/modm` folder.

Most of our examples compile with SCons by default, however you can generate
a CMake build script by including the [CMake build script generator module](https://modm.io/reference/module/modm-build-cmake).

```
lbuild build -m "::cmake"
```


To compile the example and modm, call SCons or CMake:

```
scons
# or for CMake
make cmake           # call just once
make build-release
```

To upload the example to your development board:

```
scons program
# or for CMake
make upload-release
```

You can also debug your examples. Make sure you've compiled and uploaded the
debug profile first, because debugging a release profile is annoying:

```
scons program profile=debug
# or for CMake
make upload-debug
```

Then just do this to open up GDB in TUI mode:

```
scons gdb profile=debug
# or for CMake
make openocd
# open another shell to this location
make gdb
```
